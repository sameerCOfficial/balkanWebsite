                    Boys were selected according to laid out criteria in “herds” of about 100-150 to be converted to Islam.
                    They were transported to Istanbul to begin training according to Turkish customs and Islamic religion to become the Sultan’s slaves.
                    In 1603 - 1604, four groups of janissary officers were sent out to four parts of the empire to levy children
                    Officers mainly levied male children of Christian families as a form of tribute.
                    The levied children were then put through a selective testing process. Those that showed the most promise were placed in the palace schools while the rest were then hired out for servitude for the next 3-5 years
                    In these towns, they worked as agricultural laborers and learned the Turkish language and Islamic practices
                    They would then be called back to Istanbul to work for 3-5 years before being enlisted for the Janissary army
